# Readings - Code
For many readings, there are exercises to practice what you've just read. This is where I put all the follow along material and the exercise solutions. Most of them are for JavaScript and are based in the console, so in this special case there is no link to a website.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Readings are mostly from:
- MDN
- Eloquent JS
- Javascript.info
- The JS Way
- 

## Lessons Learned:

Everything from learning exactly what a function is to Promises. The lessons learned are many, and is the compartmentalisation of my whole software engineering journey. 


## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
